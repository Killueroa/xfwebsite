        Hi! I am Xavier Figueroa and this is my website! I am currently a sophomore at Texas A&M University studying
        Mechanical Engineering. I designed this to be a place to put my projects, skills, and overall experiences
        I have gained during my college career!
        <br><br>
        I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, where I went to High School at Plano East and then continued my education at
        Texas A&M. So far, after my freshman year, I have found it a great experience and enjoy the opportunities there!
        College has been an excellent resource to continue to develop my technical and professional skills and meet new people!
